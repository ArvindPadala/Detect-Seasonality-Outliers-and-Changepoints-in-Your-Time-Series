What is seasonality?
Seasonality is one of the key components that make up a time series. Seasonality refers to systematic movements that repeat over a given period with a similar intensity.

Seasonal variations can be caused by various factors, such as weather, calendar, or economic conditions. Examples abound in various applications. Flights are more expensive in the summer because of vacations and tourism. Another example is consumer spending which increases in December due to holidays.

Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if you can detect the sudden changes in your time series like below in a few lines of code?
